Viewed as a group, they will\nlikely lead you down the sixth, and correct, path to resolving the issue. If there is one\ntake-away from this chapter, as well as this book, it should be that focusing on a single\npiece of information alone can often lead to an incorrect diagnosis of a problem.  \n\n#### Defining a Troubleshooting Methodology\nFairly early on in any analysis, I'll take a look at the wait statistics, in the sys.dm_os_\nwait_stats Dynamic Management View (DMV), to identify any major resource waits in\nthe system, at the operating system level.  \n\n#### Wait Statistics: the Basis for Troubleshooting\nAs a part of the normal operations of SQL Server, a number of wait conditions exist\nwhich are non-problematic in nature and generally expected on the server. These wait\nconditions can generally be queried from the sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks DMV for the\nsystem sessions.\n\n```SQL\nSELECT DISTINCT\n     wt.wait_type\nFROM sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks AS wt\nJOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS s ON wt.session_id = s.session_id\nWHERE s.is_user_process = 0\n```\n\nWhen looking at the wait statistics being tracked by SQL Server, it's important that these\nwait types are eliminated from the analysis, allowing the more problematic waits in the\nsystem to be identified. One of the things I do as a part of tracking wait information is to\nmaintain a script that filters out the non-problematic wait types.\n\n```SQL\nSELECT TOP 10\nwait_type ,\nmax_wait_time_ms wait_time_ms ,\nsignal_wait_time_ms ,\nwait_time_ms - signal_wait_time_ms AS resource_wait_time_ms ,\n100.0 * wait_time_ms / SUM(wait_time_ms) OVER ( )\nAS percent_total_waits ,\n100.0 * signal_wait_time_ms / SUM(signal_wait_time_ms) OVER ( )\nAS percent_total_signal_waits ,\n100.0 * ( wait_time_ms - signal_wait_time_ms )\n/ SUM(wait_time_ms) OVER ( ) AS percent_total_resource_waits\nFROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats\nWHERE wait_time_ms > 0 -- remove zero wait_time\nAND wait_type NOT IN -- filter out additional irrelevant waits\n( 'SLEEP_TASK', 'BROKER_TASK_STOP', 'BROKER_TO_FLUSH',\n'SQLTRACE_BUFFER_FLUSH','CLR_AUTO_EVENT', 'CLR_MANUAL_EVENT',\n'LAZYWRITER_SLEEP', 'SLEEP_SYSTEMTASK', 'SLEEP_BPOOL_FLUSH',\n'BROKER_EVENTHANDLER', 'XE_DISPATCHER_WAIT', 'FT_IFTSHC_MUTEX',\n'CHECKPOINT_QUEUE', 'FT_IFTS_SCHEDULER_IDLE_WAIT',\n'BROKER_TRANSMITTER', 'FT_IFTSHC_MUTEX', 'KSOURCE_WAKEUP',\n'LOGMGR_QUEUE', 'ONDEMAND_TASK_QUEUE',\n'REQUEST_FOR_DEADLOCK_SEARCH', 'XE_TIMER_EVENT', 'BAD_PAGE_PROCESS',\n'DBMIRROR_EVENTS_QUEUE', 'BROKER_RECEIVE_WAITFOR',\n'PREEMPTIVE_OS_GETPROCADDRESS', 'PREEMPTIVE_OS_AUTHENTICATIONOPS',\n'WAITFOR', 'DISPATCHER_QUEUE_SEMAPHORE', 'XE_DISPATCHER_JOIN',\n'RESOURCE_QUEUE' )\nORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC\n```\n\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":3,"$":{"0":{"v":"Books","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n![[Database#^k7i59zrcxn1o:#*]]","n":1}}}]}
